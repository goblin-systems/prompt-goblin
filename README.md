Voice-to-text desktop app powered by Gemini, built with Tauri + Vanilla TypeScript.
> Goblin note: screaming, yapping, and dramatic rambling all count as valid "speaking" in this establishment.

## Contribution Guide

Contributions are accepted in the form of GitHub issues that define specifications for bug fixes and improvements.

Please provide a balanced level of detail: enough context and requirements to make implementation clear, but not so much that the specification becomes bloated.

This process ensures implementation is done by a trusted AI agent run by the repository maintainer, and is required for security reasons.

Direct pull requests are not accepted. Start with an issue first.
